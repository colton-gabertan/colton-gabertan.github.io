I'm Colton Gabertan. My goal is to immerse myself in all things infosec and contribute to the overall security posture of anyone I have the pleasure of working with. I specialize in malware analysis & reverse engineering and have experience working in this space on the FLARE team at [Mandiant]!

I previously taught an intro to appsec course for a non-profit organization called [CodePath], which is aimed at providing supplemental computer science and technical training to under-represented groups of people in the tech space. 

Currently, school is in session, and during the semester, I work in my university's office of information technology as a systems engineer. This work involves using DevOps practices in order to deploy and decommission servers for customers, while maintaining site availability, reliability, and security of our infrastructure. There are a couple of infosec-related projects I'd like to work on as I gain this new skillset, and you may expect them to be published on this site as they roll out!

On the side, I'm involved with my university's security club, Layer Zero. This club allowed myself and a group of like-minded individuals to lay the foundation for the UNLV Free Cyber Clinic. This organization is aimed at providing small businesses with free cybersecurity consultations in order to help them more closely comply with industry standards and prevent intrusions that may put the members of our community out of business. We are involved with federal entities such as the Small Business Development Council (SBDC), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the United States Cyber Command (USCC).
