I'm Colton Gabertan. My goal is to immerse myself in all things infosec and contribute to the overall security posture of anyone I have the pleasure of working with. I specialize in malware analysis & reverse engineering and work in this space on the FLARE team at [Mandiant]!

On the side, I currently teach an intro to appsec course for a non-profit organization called [CodePath], which is aimed at providing supplemental computer science and technical training to under-represented groups of people in the tech space. I also work under the University of Nevada Las Vegas to develop the Free Cyber Clinic. This project involves assessing the maturity of small businesses in the valley, while also providing basic cyber security consultations.
